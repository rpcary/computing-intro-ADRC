#This tutorial will cover some of the basics of connecting computers over a
# network with the command-line interface.

#List of the tools used:
#    ssh 
#    scp (-rp)
#    rsync (-av/z)
#    sftp(put/mput,get/mget) or ftp/wget
#    windows drive mount

### ssh ###
#From the man pages: "
#    syntax: ssh [user@]hostname [command]
#    ssh is a program for logging into a remote machine and for executing
# commands on a remote machine. 
#    If command is specified, command is executed on the remote host instead
# of a login shell."

#To end/exit an ssh session, simply type 'exit'.

# Examples:

# The following are simple forms for logging into a new shell on the computer
# named [hostname] with the [username] account
# ssh username@hostname
# ssh username@hostname.domain
# ssh username@IPaddress / e.g. ssh 128.20.255.255 (this is an historically
# 'early' address in the IPv4 system)

# If you do not specify a username, your current $USER will be used
# Thus,
# ssh hostname.domain
# ... is equivalent to 
# ssh $USER@hostname.domain

# Go ahead and try to connect to a few machines on the
# http://intranet.brainmap.wisc.edu/brainwiki/index.php/WADRC_Workstations
# page.

#Note: If you want a program with a GUI to display on your local machine,
# you will need an X11 configured system, and to use the -X option to enable
# X11 forwarding (unless it is used by default). This can be a bit touchy at
# present depending on what computers you are going to/from, so let someone
# know if you're having trouble with this. 
# ssh -X username@hostname.domain
# Using the upper case 'X' flag enables, and the lower case 'x' disables X11
# forwarding. 

### scp ###
#[copied with edits from
# http://stackoverflow.com/questions/343711/transferring-files-over-ssh]
#Syntax: 
#$ scp <source> <destination>

#To copy a file from B to A while logged into B:

#$ scp /path/to/file username@A:/path/to/destination

#To copy a file from B to A while logged into A:

#$ scp username@B:/path/to/file /path/to/destination

#[end web source]
#Of note: You will often be asked to enter a password when connecting to a
# remote machine via ssh. If you are connecting as a different user, be sure
# to specify that username. If you are using the same username, it does not
# need to be specified. 

#Some useful flags are:
#    '-r' -- the 'recursive' flag which will copy all files and folders
# contained in a specified directory.
#    '-p' -- 'preserve' the modification/access times and 'modes' from the
# original file(s)


### rsync ###
#rsync works much like scp based on similar syntax. Either the source or
# destination of the files/folders can be remote, but not both. [some
# material taken from linuxcommand.org/man_pages/rsync1.html]

#Examples:
# To 'upload' any local files with '.ext' from your folder on computer A to
# a remote computer B /tmp directory:
#$ rsync -t *.ext B:tmp/
# The -t preserveS the timestamp on the files. 

# To 'download' all files in a 'folder' from remote computer B to your
# computer A.
#$ rsync -av username@B:/path/to/folder/ /tmp/folder/

# If you want to compress the files for transfer, simply add the -z flag.
#$ rsync -avz /data/tmp/folder/ username@B:/Users/username/folder/

### sftp ###
#sftp is usually used if you don't know where the file you are trying to get
# is, or if you are using a very old batching system for file transfers. In
# any case, it is much like scp in batch mode, and like the shell in
# interactive mode. 
#Syntax:
#   sftp [user@]host[:file ...]
#   sftp [user@]host[:dir[/]]
#   sftp [user@]host

#The last of these calls to sftp will open the interactive mode, once you
# have logged in to a temporary shell. The sftp shell is not as extensive as
# your normal shell. Try to limit yourself to 'ls', 'cd', and the get or put
# commands. 

#To bring a file from the remote machine to yours, use the 'get' command
# while in the interactive shell.
#   sftp [user@]host
#   sftp> cd /path/to/file.txt
#   sftp> get file.txt
#   sftp> bye

#This will have downloaded the 'file.txt' file to the directory from which
# you started the sftp session.

### windows drive mount ###
# From 'Computer' (Win7) folder, or 'Control Panel' (NT and XP) and select
# "Map Network Drive"...[works in Windows XP through 7]
# Pick a letter ('S' preferred for /mounts/data)
# \\Server\shared_folder should be:
# \\braindata.dom.wisc.edu\data
# Select 'reconnect at logon'
# If your DOM username is different than your ADRC username for some reason
# (it shouldn't be), you may need to 'Connect using different credentials',
# in which case you would provide the ADRC username for connecting to the
# ADRC file system. 
# Select 'Finish', and you will attempt to connect. 
# Assuming all of the paths, names, and passwords are correct, you should
# now see S:\ in the list of network drives, allowing you to easily
# drag/drop files to and from your computer.
